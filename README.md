# 🏠 House Price Prediction App (XGBoost + Streamlit)

A simple and interactive **Machine Learning app** that predicts house prices using the **XGBoost regression model**.  
Built with a clean and easy-to-use interface designed for Indian users.

---

##  Features

- Predicts **house prices in ₹ (INR)**
- Built using **XGBoost Regression**
- Easy-to-use **Streamlit web app**
- **Feature importance** chart to visualize which factors influence prices most
- User inputs are simplified into sliders and text fields for a smooth experience

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost** for model training
- **Joblib** for model saving/loading
- **Streamlit** for web interface

##  How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/xgb_housing_app.git
   cd xgb_housing_app
2. **Install dependencies**
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the app**
    streamlit run app.py
Streamlit will automatically open your default browser,
or visit  http://localhost:8501

 ##  Model Training

    The model was trained in Google Colab using the California Housing Dataset.

    Steps:

    Data cleaning and feature selection
    Splitting data into train/test sets
    Training with XGBoost Regressor
    Saving trained model using joblib
